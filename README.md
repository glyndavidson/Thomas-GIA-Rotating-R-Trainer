## ⭐ Overview
This web app generates randomised pairs of rotated / mirrored **letter R glyphs**, and your goal is to identify how many of the **two row pairs** could match if rotated (mirroring does *not* count).

The tool mimics the behaviour of the official Thomas test while remaining distraction-free and fast to use.
